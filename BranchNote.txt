The HEAD is the currently referenced Git commit that is currently checked out. 
The HEAD should in practice be pointing toward a defined branch at all times, which in turn points at the most recent commit of such a branch.
Otherwise, if a commit is checked out without a branch referencing it, it wil have no idenifying key or label to it besides its long and unwieldy commit ID hash.
